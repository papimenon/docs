# Data Model Description

The data model schema defines a set of standards for AI agent content representation that aims to:

- Define common data structure to facilitate content standardisation, validation, and interoperability.
- Ensure unique agent identification to address content discovery and consumption.
- Provide extension capabilities to enable third-party features.
