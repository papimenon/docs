# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To build the project and work with the code, you need the following
installed components in your system:

### Taskfile

Taskfile is required to run all the build operations. Follow the
[installation instructions](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) in the Taskfile
documentations to find the best installation method for your system.
